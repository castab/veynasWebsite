If I could give 10 stars I would.  I called them on a Thursday to pick up some large items I purchased from Sears (Sears does not deliver closeout/display items, only new items from warehouse) so, we scheduled for Saturday delivery, which was great.  They called me back a couple of hours later and said they we’re able to re-arrange for same day delivery & asked if I’d like my items delivered sooner.  I was thrilled!  They knew I purchased two items, but when they got to the store, Sears was only giving them one of the items.  They confirmed on my behalf there should be two items to pick up and made sure Sears gave me all items I  purchased.  Talk about going above and beyond!  They were very nice people, very kind and professional.  I will use them from now on for all my large item delivery or moving needs."},{"author_name":"Lina Tatham","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100078629375713013360/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-suX40NEclEA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAi4/d84RCYDe4oQ/s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo/photo.jpg","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"3 months ago","text":"I highly recommend this company.  We used them twice within the past 2 years.  They are extremely professional and very careful when moving furniture.  No damages to any of the property or belongings.  Their prices are very reasonable.  I will definitely use them for future services."}]},"status":"OK","date_stored":"2018-10-02T02:32:11-07:00"}
