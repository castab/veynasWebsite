# Summary
My Dad's business has been gaining traction and has been slowly reaching customers through word-of-mouth.  To get a jump on marketing, I wrote a responsive, mobile-first website using Bootstrap while using the AngularJS framework for more involved data-binding and manipulation.  Aside from business cards and the logo work on the freight trucks, this will also be an attempt at unifying the company brand.

## Modern Expectations
Many people expect results in a relatively quick matter - we're aiming for a load time of less than 2 seconds and hoping to get down to, ideally, less than 1 second.  The face of a website also tells a lot about the company behind it.  Subconciously, a visitor on the website may ask:

- Is the website fluid?
- Is navigation easy?
- Did I find what I'm looking for?
- Does this website 'look' nice?

We've all done it - we will easily close the browser or tab if the website just looks 'off.'  This likely increases for unfamililar sites for which we did not first gain reference to (either by word-of-mouth or from a different website).  So, first impressions are everything - *especially* for a brand new business trying to gain customers for the first time.

## Student of the Web
Aside from establishing a piece of the web for my Dad's business, I'm also using this as a learning experience.
I'd like to:
- Learn about Bootstrap, jQuery, Popper
- Learn about CSS
- Can I implement AngularJS? (Edit: Yes, it's possible)
